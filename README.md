## Methodologies

### Content-based filtering
- Recommends items similar to those the user has shown interested in before by leveraging the features or characteristics of items
- Approach: Cosine similarity -> Higher cosine similarity indicates greater content similarity

### Collaborative-based filtering
- Makes recommendations based on the preferences and behaviour of other users with similar preferences
- Approach: kNN, Matrix Factorization, Deep Learning
